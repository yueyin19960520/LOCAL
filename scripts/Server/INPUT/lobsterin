! First, enter the energetic window in eV (relative to the Fermi level):
COHPStartEnergy -10
COHPEndEnergy 10
!
! Then, specify which types of valence orbitals to use:
!includeOrbitals s p d
! You can also specify the basis functions per element manually, e.g.:
! basisFunctions Ga 4s 4p
! basisFunctions Sr 5s 4s 4p ! Sr_sv potential
useRecommendedBasisFunctions
!
! Now define the pairs for which COHP analysis etc. should be done.
! The atoms are numbered as per order in the PAW-code control file.
!cohpBetween atom 1 atom 10
!
! If you are interested in single orbital COHPs, you can get all the pairs
! like s-s, s-p_x, ..., p_z-p_z. Uncomment this line to switch it on:


cohpBetween atom 49 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 50 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 51 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 52 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 53 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 54 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 55 atom 57 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 56 atom 57 orbitalWise


cohpBetween atom 49 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 50 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 51 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 52 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 53 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 54 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 55 atom 58 orbitalWise
cohpBetween atom 56 atom 58 orbitalWise

! If you want to generate the COHP pairs automatically, use this to include
! all pairs in a given distance range (in Angstrom, not in atomic units):
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5
! cohpGenerator from 1.4 to 1.5 type Ga type Sr
! and in the latter case only between the specified elements
